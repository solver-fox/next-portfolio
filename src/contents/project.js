        problem: `In 2017, Smart Sparrow began a project to build an entirely new platform to
        from the ground up to serve as the most powerful tool for educators to
        create online learning experiences. The old platform was built in Flash, and
        there were a number of user experience problems to solve in the process of
        moving the platform to Javascript. The primary goals for the project were
        reducing barriers to collaboration, and making the platform both easier for
        new users, but with plenty of room to scale for advanced users.`,
        outcome: `Collaborated with designers and product owners to build security platforms that are safe from potential threats and vulnerabilities.`
