The wallet supports all Ethereum-based networks, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Additionally, the platform provides a beginner-friendly interface, secure enclave security, a web3 dApp browser, TokenScript support, and the ability to interact with DeFi, DAO, and games with SmartTokens.`,
